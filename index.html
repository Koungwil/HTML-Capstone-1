        <h3>Quality Engineer</h3>
        <h4>October 2022 - Current</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Engaged in a pivotal role within a project centered around updating
                its loan and mortgage systems, overseeing the development of 
                comprehensive testcases for over 150 project functionalities. 
                Committed to elevating efficiency, I pursued the automation of test
                cases utilizing the Robot Framework. My dedication extended beyond
                work hours, dedicating personal time to gain a fundamental 
                understanding of the project’s testing requirements. As a result, 
                I have created more than 300 testcases, automating approximately 40 
                of them. My profound comprehension of the system’s intricacies 
                positioned me as a valued team member, readily available to provide 
                insights on any aspect related to the project.

                business counterpart. Would have to log task progress on Jira, attend
                Agile status meetings, and have a strong understanding of workflow.
                To ensure a strong sense of communication, I diligently added daily
                comments to my Jira tasks, which served as the basis for creating
                comprehensive weekly reports. Also, became an active member of 
                meetings by contributing to healthy discussions and bringing up
                any concerns if necessary.

            <li>Tasked with creating and executing accessibility testcases for the 
                front-end changes to the system. Would book meetings with developers 
                and members of the business team to understand which of the 22 different 
                guidelines were necessary for the project.
